Banners are peripheral content, so initially they need to <strong><em>hook</em> </strong>the user\u2019s attention. This should take 2-4 seconds and not include the primary message unless it\u2019s a particularly strong offer that can be substantiated (e.g \u201cFREE MONEY\u201d\u2026!). If ads begins with the key message and then moves on before being substantiated users miss the whole point of the banner and therefore will need the ad to loop to see it again (by which point their propensity to do so will be very low). More intelligent ads will intrigue the users initially and then deliver the payoff. <strong><em>Engage</em> </strong>the user with a hook, before you sell to\u00a0them.</p>\n<h4>Inform</h4>\n<p>Once the user has noticed the ad, the key message/offer should be delivered in a clear but engaging manner. If the ad is expanding, the user should be sufficiently enticed to open the ad. If the ad is standard- then hit the user with a proposition that is strong enough to get them to the call to action frame. <strong><em>Inform</em> </strong>the user of the message. You will have the opportunity to speak to your user for around 10 seconds- so use the flow of this creative narrative and imagine being spoken to by the ad. Copy. Image.\u00a0Timing.</p>\n<h3>Inspire</h3>\n<p>Ok so, we\u2019ve delivered our story or offer, now a DR banner\u2019s job is to make the user click. The art of the call-to-action (CTA) is still one of the most challenging. \u201cClick Here\u201d has evolved to include dynamic copy, more oblique prompts and the design of the button is every designers biggest challenge. CTAs should summarise the offer and <strong>inspire </strong>the user to click. Thats it. That\u2019s the job of the humble DR\u00a0banner.</p>\n<p>Where Rich media is used to deliver site content or sign-up functionality then CTAs become interactive content funnels that guide the users all the way to the sign-up or point of interaction. \u201cWhat do we want users to do in this ad and how do we make them, whilst giving them a good time\u201d is the challenge of a rich media\u00a0CTA.</p>\n<p>This is the creative thinking approach behind all of our campaigns. But what can we identify as the \u201cNo-Nos\u201d? Here\u2019s just a\u00a0few.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banner creative should never just animate a press ad, or repurpose a TVC. Again, users didn\u2019t come to that webpage to look at subliminal press ads (they won\u2019t click) or view TV ads (they won\u2019t watch them).

Dynamic copy is incredibly powerful, so use it where possible to present real and live\u00a0offers.</li>\n<li>Equally, substantiate any offer you make clearly. The integrity of an offer is more important than a bigger\u00a0offer.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t create an ad your mum couldn\u2019t follow.
